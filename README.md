WeSports
A Web Application that allows users to meet cool people and play sports with them. The app was built using ruby on rails as the backend and CSS Bootstrap as the frontend. 

Getting Started
By running the rails server, you will be able to use the backend. Opening the index.html in the browser starts the app. Then, if you are a first time visitor, create an account and check out how the app works.

Prerequisites
You need to make a rails api using the new rails app command in the terminal. Then, use rails g model command to create models needed. After that, rails g controller command was used to create controllers and their corresponding views.
